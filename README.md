# Automated Financial Dashboard with Python

**Status:** ðŸš§ In Initial Development ðŸš§

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a comprehensive personal finance dashboard from scratch. This serves as a practical learning ground to develop and showcase advanced skills in data manipulation, data visualization, and web application development using Python. The application is designed to process bank statements and provide interactive, actionable insights into spending habits.

## Planned Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Core Libraries:** Pandas (for data manipulation), Streamlit (for the interactive web UI)
* **Database:** Oracle Autonomous Database (Leveraging the Always Free Tier)
* **Deployment (Future):** Docker, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

## Feature Roadmap (MVP)
-   [ ] **Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Develop scripts to ingest and cleanse financial data from various sources (starting with CSV files), using Pandas to handle inconsistencies and structure the data.
-   [ ] **Phase 2: Core Visualization:** Create the first version of the dashboard using Streamlit, displaying basic analytics like spending by category, income vs. expense, and trends over time.
-   [ ] **Phase 3: Secure User Authentication:** Implement a robust and secure login system to ensure user data privacy.
-   [ ] **Phase 4: Cloud Database Integration:** Migrate the data backend from local files to the Oracle Autonomous Database, establishing a reliable and scalable data persistence layer.
